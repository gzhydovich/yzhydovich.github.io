		<h2>Quality Assurance vs. Quality Control</h2>
		<p>Some people may confuse the term quality assurance with quality control (QC). Although the two concepts share similarities, there are important distinctions between them.
		In effect, QA provides the overall guidelines used anywhere, and QC is a production-focused process â€“ for things such as inspections. QA is any systematic process for making sure a product meets specified requirements, whereas QC addresses other issues, such as individual inspections or defects.
		In terms of software development, QA practices seek to prevent malfunctioning code or products, while QC implements testing and troubleshooting and fixes code.</p>

			<h3>From a formal standpoint the process of QA can be broken down into four key elements:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Determining the cause of the problem;</li>
				<li>Analyzing the amount of effort and engagement needed to fix the problem;</li>
				<li>Defining the most effective way of fixing it;</li>
				<li>Considering possible backfires upon making changes;</li>
